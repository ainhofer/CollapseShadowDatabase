# CollapseShadowDatabase
This repository stores an evolving and curated database of building collapses (total or partial) triggered by any event (e.g., earthquake, hurricane, flooding, explosions, geotechnical instability, liquefaction, corrosion, deterioration). 
The focus of this database is collecting features of the buildings and information on the collapse mechanism, collapse extent, and debris field that could inform the development and refinement of post-disaster safety cordon criteria.
The initial database was assembled by the SEAONC Disaster and Emergency Services committee in 2023 during the development of the FEMA P2055-2 report "Recommendations for Cordoning Earthquake-Damaged Buildings ".
This report is the first spark envisioned to evolve grounded on the data collected in this community effort database.
